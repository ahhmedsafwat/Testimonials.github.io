                I received a job offer mid-course, and subjects I learned were
                current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly
                feel I got every penny's worth.

                had an amazing experineces here. I signed up for weeks was the

                >Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theris who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and sraff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particlular, was
                outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no turorial could ever have, in fact , i've often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience, it
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack develper after
                receiving muluiple offers. 100% recmmend!</q

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                themselves. Getting guidance form them and learing form their
                experineces was easy.

                find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence
                necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
                as a capale junior developer. the standard is above the rest.
                You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
                community of smart and amazing people.</q
